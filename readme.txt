Opt-In Panda gives visitors a reason to subscribe right now in return to instant access to your valuable content (e.g. downloads, discounts, videos and so on).

Hide your premium content behind an optin form and watch your email subscription rates burst through the roof. Easily create in-content freebies and serve them to your subscribers only.

With Opt-In Panda, you will be able:

- Effectively and easily convert visitors into subscribers.
- Build large mailing lists on MailChimp, Aweber, GetReponse (and other services).
- Send more emails and increase your income.

<h3>Single Opt-In, Double Opt-In and Quick Email Confirmation</h3>

The plugin equally well works with Single Opt-In (without email confirmation) and Double Opt-In (with email confirmation) modes. Only you decide which mode to use.

We done our best to make the Double Opt-In email confirmation process as quick and pleasant as possible.
