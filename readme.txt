Give visitors a strong reason to leave their emails on your website by locking a piece of content behind an attractive opt-in form.

== Description ==

<strong>Helps to collect emails of visitors by locking a portion of content on your website behind the beautiful opt-in form.</strong>

Opt-In Panda locks a portion of content on a webpage, by hiding or blurring it, and asks the visitor to enter his email address (opt-in) to unlock your content.

In other words, it gives visitors a reason to subscribe right now in return to instant access to your valuable content (e.g. downloads, discounts, videos and so on).

<strong>Boost Converting Visitors Into Subscribers & Customers</strong>

Hide your premium content behind an optin form and watch your email subscription rates burst through the roof. Easily create in-content freebies and serve them to your subscribers only.

With Opt-In Panda, you will be able:

- Effectively and easily convert visitors into subscribers.
- Build large mailing lists on MailChimp, Aweber, GetReponse (and other services).
- Send more emails and increase your income.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

The plugin is packaged with the following features:
 
* **Built-in Advanced Analytics.** Easily identify which lockers on which pages are out-performing others, how to optimize your lockers and what you could do differently to improve your results.

* **SEO Friendly.** Your locked content is still visible for search bots for better SEO by default. Of course you can turn off this feature.

* **4 Types of Locks.** Lock any content manually via shortcodes or setup batch lock via one of 3 powerful modes (“Skip & Lock”, “More Tag”, “CSS Selector”).

* **Visual Composer.** The Social Locker is fully compatible with the Visual Composer.

* **Optimized For Mobile.** We have adapted the plugin for mobile devices. Mobile users can obtain access to your locked content as well as desktop users.

* **Fast Loading.** The plugin is well optimized and doesn’t add extra loads on your website. Confirmed with tests from the P3 plugin and New Relic.

* **Developer Friendly.** Use the plugin events (Unlock, Lock, Ready) and hooks for customization and creating your own extensions.
